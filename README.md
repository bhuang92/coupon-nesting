==============

Python project to implement a packing problem solver in an engineering setting.

There are three core parts of this project:
*	 using the libraries `xlrd` and `tkinter`, parse information from a spreadsheet that the engineers will use as a template to define the rectangles to be packed in the box
*	designing the algorithm to be efficient in terms of cutting and time-efficient
*	displaying the optimal packing arrangement with `tkinter` canvas widget
