==============

Python project to implement a packing problem solver in an engineering setting.

There are three core parts of this project:
*	parsing information from a spreadsheet using the libraries `xlrd` and `tkinter` that the engineers will use as a template.
*	designing the algorithm
*	displaying the optimal packing arrangement with `tkinter` canvas widget
